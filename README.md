# Text Case CLI
*A command line interface version of Text Case.*

[Text Case][tc] is a text-transformation app for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. (By me)

This project is a related tool, but essentialy a minor rewrite of the text transformation formats to make it open-source, and available via the command line.

Just as a warning, a lot of this code was copied from older rewrites of Text Case, it's not exactly in a finished state. I'll be working on refactoring the existing formats, adding more, and in general making the code/tool better.

## Install

You can, of course, checkout and build this project by running `swift build`, but if you want to make your life a bit easier, you can install Text Case CLI via a custom [Homebrew][hb] tap:

```
brew tap chrishannah/textcase
brew install textcase
```

[tc]: http://textcase.app
[hb]: https://brew.sh
